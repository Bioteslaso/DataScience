New discussion - Lab 3: "sklearn.datasets.samples_generator" has been replaced with "sklearn.datasets.make_blobs": ML

Hi, the Lab3 code is not working correctly as the new scikit-learn version has changed "sklearn.datasets.samples_generator" to "sklearn.datasets.make_blobs". Please change this in the future. :)
